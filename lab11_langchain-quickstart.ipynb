    "\n",
    "- **Understanding LangChain**: Get to know the basics of LangChain and how it is used in developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "- **Chains in LangChain**: Explore the concept of `chains` in LangChain, which are sequences of actions or operations orchestrated to perform complex tasks.\n",
    "- **Integration with MLflow**: Learn how LangChain integrates with MLflow, a platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including logging, tracking, and deploying models.\n",
    "- **Practical Application**: Apply your knowledge to build a LangChain chain that acts like a sous chef, focusing on the preparation steps of a recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background on LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a Python-based framework that simplifies the development of applications using language models. It is designed to enhance context-awareness and reasoning in applications, allowing for more sophisticated and interactive functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Chain?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain Definition**: In LangChain, a `chain` refers to a series of interconnected components or steps designed to accomplish a specific task. \n",
    "- **Chain Example**: In our tutorial, we'll create a chain that simulates a sous chef's role in preparing ingredients and tools for a recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up LangChain and MLflow**: Initialize and configure both LangChain and MLflow.\n",
    "2. **Create a Sous Chef Chain**: Develop a LangChain chain that lists ingredients, describes preparation techniques, organizes ingredient staging, and details cooking implements preparation for a given recipe.\n",
    "3. **Log and Load the Model**: Utilize MLflow to log the chain model and then load it for prediction.\n",
    "4. **Run a Prediction**: Execute the chain to see how it would prepare a restaurant dish for a specific number of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid foundation in using LangChain with MLflow and an understanding of how to construct and manage chains for practical applications.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Completions Model**: This model does not maintain contextual information across requests. It's ideal for tasks where each request is standalone and doesn't depend on past interactions. Offers flexibility for a variety of non-conversational applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Contextual Memory**: The lack of memory of previous interactions means the model is best suited for one-off requests or scenarios where continuity of the conversation is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparisons with the ChatCompletions Model Type**: Tailored for conversational AI, maintaining context across multiple exchanges for a continuous conversation. Suitable for chatbots or applications where dialogue history is crucial.\n",
